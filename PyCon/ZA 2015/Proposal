Kivy Showcase: a short exploration of how Kivy is changing the world

In talk, I'll look at some real-world success stories using Kivy. Kivy is full stack, multi-touch, cross platform framework, running on devices from exibition size interactive surfaces to desktops and mobile devices.

We'll briefly look at some exciting projects using Kivy, namely:

    Project Liatris: a new, open source project using kivy touch devices to control robots.

    RacepCapture Pro: A race-car telemetry system that uses kivy interactive displays both in-car and in post-session analytics interaction.

    Brain Trainer Plus: A mental dexterity trainer deployed to old age homes and medical treatment facilities. It been shown effective in treating dimentia and other mental disorders, as well as bringing a greatly enhanced quality-of-life to the aged and mentally ill.
    
    CAMI Educational products: CAMI is currently using kivy to provide a variety of educational content on both mobile and desktop platforms. The rich feature set of Kivy and it's built in Animation objects make developing compelling, responsive mobile interactions trivial.
    
    The Icarus touch and Touch live projects: creating radically new and exciting interactive musical instruments.
    
All of this is being delived using Kivy, a free, open source Python/Cython framework that runs on a watch. I kid you not.

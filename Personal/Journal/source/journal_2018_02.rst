01/01/2018 - The Happiness Advantage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    Happiness is not the belief that we don't need to change.
    It is the realization that we can.,

    Shawn Achor

Even after the first few pages, one can tell this is going to be valuable book
for the process I am currently going through. The emotional fluctuations
and "downs" are really my trigger points. By being happier and more balanced,
as well as more productive, will really help.

Avoiding those bumps are going to be very important from here on. The weekly
tests will also help focus on recovering.  This goes a long way to building
the "recovery capital" that Judith mentioned. I think I need to read up more
about that.

02/02/2018 - Recovery Capital
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    The essence of recovery is a lived experience of improved life quality
    and a sense of empowerment; the principles of recovery focus on
    the central ideas of hope, choice, freedom and aspiration

    Best and Laudet

Judging from the promenent occurence of academic works when googling "recovery
capital", it appears this is a relatively new branch of study and treatment.
Much of what I right here is gleaned from `Best and Laudet's research
<https://www.thersa.org/globalassets/pdfs/blogs/a4-recovery-capital-230710-v5.pdf>`_.

It described "recovery capital" as the sum of resources necessary to initiate
and sustain recovery from substance misuse.The UK Drug Policy Commission
defined recovery as *voluntarily sustained control over substance use which
maximises health and wellbeing and participation in the rights, roles and
responsibilities of society*.  This definition involves three primary
component parts:

* wellbeing and quality of life
* some measure of community engagement or citizenship
* some measure of sobriety

The essence is that recovery is a lived experience of improved quality of life
and sense of empowerment. The ideas of hope, choice, freedom and aspiration
are experienced rather than diagnosed.

04/02/2018 - Components of Recovery Capital
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cloud and Granveld argue there are 4 components to recovery capital.

* Social capital: the sum of resources that each person has as a result of
  their relationships, including support and obligations to groups and family.
* Physical capital: tangible assets such as property or money taht may increase
  recovery options.
* Human capital: includes skills, health, aspirations and hopes and personal
  resources that will allow the individual to prosper. Traditionally, academic
  attainment and intelligence are key elements that can help on the journey of
  recovery.
* Cultural capital: values, attitudes and beliefs that link to social
  confirmity and the ability to fir into dominant social behaviours.

Christakis and Fowler and found strong links in communities which looked at the
social contaigon of emotions, and found a "hyperdyadic effect", where an
emotions is likely spread to those closer to you, the effect decreasing through
degrees of separation. The point here is that focusing on only the individual
does not consider community influence as there is real evidence of it's social
transmission.

04/02/2018 - #1 - The Happiness Advantage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The chapter focuses on how happiness gives your brain the competative advantage.
Although we often think that happiness orbits around success, research shows us
that success orbits around happiness. But how do we define happiness?

Happiness depends on *subjective wellbeing* so it's always relative to the
person experiencing it. It's esentially the experiencing of positive emotions:
pleasure combined with a deeper sense of meaning and purpose.  Seligman has
broken it down into three measurable components: pleasure, engagement and
meaning.

Happiness causes yoru brain to improve it's functioning in various areas.
Termed the "Broaden and build theory", it makes the brain more creative,
thoughful and opon to new ideas. This broadening effect has it's roots in
biology. Positive emotions flood our brain with dopamine and seratonin, which
super charges the learning centres in our brain: they help organize
information, improve our speed of re-call and length of time we retain
information. They enable us to sustain more neural connections, thus
increasing concentration and the complexity of thought we can maintain.

It also helps reduce stress, which has an "undoing effect" by reversing the
advantages mentioned above. Here are some concrete and proven actions you can
take to improve your happiness. 

* Meditate.
* Find something to look forward to. Evcen if it's distant, research shown the
  mere anticipation of something please can raise endorphin levels by 27%.
* Commit conscious acts of kinds. These need to be deliberate.
* Infuse positivity into your environment by placing object which please you
  or remind you of something that makes you happy.
* Exercise
* Spend money on experiences, not stuff.
* Exercise a signature strength. To find some of yours,

04/02/2018 - #2 - The Fulcrum Effect
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it,
    and I shall move the world.

Our power to maximioze our potential is based on two things:

* the length of our lever: how much potential power and possibility we believe
  we have.
* the position of the fulcrum: the mindet with which we generate the the power
  to change.

The world is nor subjective and fixed by very much influenced by our
interpretation of it. Studies show that people who had to act your reversed
certain ageing process. Placebos work. Maids whow were told their work burnt
energy lost weight. Asiam women who were told Asians were better and Maths
improved and did better. 

Dr. Marcel Kinsbourne, a neuroscientist, explains that our expectations create
brain patterns that can be a real as those created by the outside world. These
neurons fire as if the event was taking place. What this means is important:
*the mental construction of our daily activities, more than the activity
itself, defines our realiy.

Positivty makes us spend our time more effectively, more efficiently and more
rewardingly. Belief in our possibility moves the fulcrum towards achieving the
possibilities. More importanly that believing in our current ability is
believing we can change the abilities. Those with a growth mindset out perform
those with a fixed mindset in almost every way and, over time, bu orders of
magnitude. It opens our minds to learning and growth and greatly improves our
ability to make use of oppotunities.

This also applies to our effect on other people. Simply believeing in them
improves the way they perform. The `Pygmalion effect
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect>`_ describes how expectations
effect others, and the Rosenthal-Jacobson study documented how even teachers
non-verbalisied expectations dramatically effected childrens performance.

Raising Emotionally Intelligent Kids
------------------------------------

Mia Von Sha wrote a powerful blog post on `this subject 
<http://www.transformationalparenting.guru/parenting-blog/raising-emotionally-intelligent-kids>`_
that had some very nice ideas for possible exercises. These included:

* Make a long list of all the feeling words you can find. Keep adding to this
  as you discover more.
* Turn these into a daily emotional tracking charts.
* Play emotional charades by placing all your newly learned words into a hat.
  Have each member pick one and act it out to see if the others can guess the
  feeling.
* Load a thesaurus onto your phone and every time you want to describe how you
  feel, find another 5 ways of saying it better.
* Read to your kids and discuss how the characters are feeling.
* Engage your children in emotional discussions. Really really listen to what
  they are saying and see if you can find the perfect word to sum it all up.
* Consider making up your own words if the perfect word doesn’t exist yet.
  Adding “hangry” to our vocabularies to describe the irritation that comes
  when you haven’t eaten enough.

16/01/2018 - Vulnerability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A talk by Brene Brown on `The power of vulnerability
<https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability>`_ provides some real
insights into human connection. The fact that shame, fear and self-doubt
prevent us from opening up, and thus thwart reall connection.

Without being open, how can we be authentic?

17/01/2018 - SCARF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A talk by David Rock on `SCARF
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isiSOeMVJQk&index=1&t=85s&list=PLBCCEC71C2E39D2F5>`_
discusses how the brain works by trying to either minimize risk or maximize
reward. To interact effectively with others, we need to consider their needs of:

* Status
* Certainty
* Autonomy
* Relatedness
* Fairness

By ensuring our interaction consider these factors, we can optimize the outcomes
of our words and actions.

18/01/2018 - Internatlized Opression
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Zed Xaba's talk on `Internalized Opression
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTN2yUVQTGg>`_ touched on some interesting ways
on which shame effects us, although it applies to many more people than black
women. The take away for me was the quote from Carl Jung.

"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will
call it fate"

19/01/2018 - The Happy Secret
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Shawn Achor's talk on `The happy secret to better work
<https://www.ted.com/talks/shawn_achor_the_happy_secret_to_better_work>`_
makes some really good points on our often reversed attitide towards work,
happiness and achievemnt. So often we look ahead and believe we will be happy
after achieving something, but when we achieve it, we simply set a new goal.


75% of our happiness is predicted by optimism levels, social support and our
ability to see stress as a challenge and not a threat. Working hard does not
make us happy, but happiness makes as more productive. Positivity makes our
brain work better.

Creating positive change can be done through:

* 3 Gratitudes
* Jounaling
* Exercise
* Meditation
* Random acts of kindness

20/01/2018 - U-ACT Recovery Coach Training
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reading through the training notes, this program looks quite interesting. I like
the way the solutions are not given of suggested, but the client is guided to
discover their own. The idea of building *Recovery Capital* is quite powerful.
The focus on process vs. solution is also empowering.

The *Recovery Coaching Framework* describes sessions in the folling way:

* CCC - Contract, Check-in, Container
  The contract is agreed and the process started in a safe, contained space.
* Questions, Listening, Values, Purpose
  Using **Authenticity**, the coach steers the process around the CCC (Chaos,
  Conflict, Crises) of addition.
* Agenda, Actions, Accountability
  There are the goals for the session and the continual focus of the coach is to
  achieve them.

In learning, it is posited that we go through 4 phases:

* Unconscious incompetence - We don't know that we don't know
* Concscious incompetence - We know that we don't know
* Conscious competence - We know that we know
* Unconscious competence - We don't know that we know

All in all, the course looks interesting, but I am still in recovery and not
ready to be a coach for anyone.

21/01/2018 - Music and the Moment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`This video
<https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1127737707273305&id=123581684355584>`_
does an amazing job of capturing what it means to 'live in moment' and why it'
really only place to live.::

    Existence, the physical universe, is basically playful.
    There is no necessity for it whatsoever.
    It isn't going anywhere.
    It doesn't have a destination it ought to arrive at.

    But it is best understood by an analogy with music.
    Because music, as an art form, is essentially playful.
    We say you play the piano, not work the piano.

22/01/2018 - Preparation for Presentaion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It was a dissappointing day. Hoping to see Stuart, Marilie never responded and
was not answering her phone. So my hopes to see Stu were dashed.

Tomorrow, I give my presentation on my origami ideas. It's funny. Now that I
feel down, what once seemed like a great and inspiring idea seems lame and
arb. Origami is my thing, so why would others be interested? The extent to which
our mood colours our reality is indeed alarming.

On the bright side, there are no urges to drink or do anything silly. My daily
meditations and Precense Process practices are helping, and I feel a strength
and purpose that is very solid. With all these troubling emotions, the way out
is through...

24/01/2018 - The Motivation Manifesto
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After a discussion around drive and motivation, Alwyn recomended a book by
Brendon Burchard. Called `The Motivation Manifesto
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqXbE18Yq-Q>`_, it seems interesting albeit
very success/achievement/western dream driven. He will be lending me the book
after I have finished the Shawn Achor one.

Today, I spoke to Judith Gordon-Drake and we made the appointment for Friday
afternoon. I hope she can help. Claire gets more bitter and angry by the day
and I really need to get the law on my side. She is not well, and any slips
I make now she will take 200% advantage of.

It's hard to keep balanced when she is attacks at every opportunity. Today when
visiting, she said I was not welcome there. It's my home and she stays there as
a guest, yet she still has this 'mightier than thou' attitude, full of rage and
righteousness.

25/01/2018 - A Brief Guide to life
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

David Collins made a post a few days ago linking to a discussion with Jordan
Peterson regarding *Gender Equality*. It was very intersesting, and Peterson had
some very un-PC but accurate comments and insights.

`A Brief Guide to Life <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE9JNMgsazc>`_ presents
a very terse, hard and real talk on motivation, success and self management.
There were many insights here, but one that struck home is using fear to drive
us to overcome intertia and procrastination. Acting on fears before they become
too big allows us to overcome them more easily and grow more quickly.

THe idea of talking to ourselves as we would others was also phrased with
insight. So often we talk to ourselves like a slave, expect ourselves to do
exactly what we said the berrate ourselves for failing. The idea of negotiating
with yourself as you would with someone you respect makes real sense, yet is
somethign we seldom do.

26/01/2018 - A Brief Guide to Life - 1. Identify the problem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Chapter 1 is entitled *Identify the Problem*. We need a purpose. Life is
worthwhile when we are engaged. *The person who awas a why can bear any how*.
Goals help to turn on positive emotion.

27/01/2018 - A Brief Guide to Life - 2. Find Meaning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    Such as are your habitual thoughts
    Such also will be the character of your mind;
    for the sould is dyed by the thoughts.

    Marcus Aurelius

*Life can be meaningful enough to justify it's suffering.*  It's not always
possible to be happy and that is a luxury. It's often a struggle. We have some
choices.

* *Nothing we do means anything*. It frees us from resposibility but also
  removes all reward. One has no resposibility.

* *Everything we do matters*. This gives us a meaningful life but brings
  resposibility.

28/01/2018 - A Brief Guide to Life - 3. Stop Procrastinating
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    Even a happy life cannot be without some measure of darkness.
    And the word happy would lose it's meaning if it were not balanced by
    sadness. It is far better to take things as they come along with patience
    and equanimity.

    Carl Jung

If you can teach people toi stand up in the face of things they are afraid of,
they get stronger. If we did what we needed to, we would be massively more
efficient.

28/01/2018 - A Brief Guide to Life - 4. Become Productive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    There is no such thing as a hopeless situation. Every single circumstance
    of your life can change.

    Rhonda Byrne

Outline the place you would like to be. Get your fears behind you, pushing
you. You want to be afraid of not achieveing your goals. Make your fears push
you. Face problems as soon as you can, so they don't grow into somethign much
bigger.

Develop a vision of how you would like your life to be and break it down into
steps. Moving towards a valued goal bring positive emotions and rewards.

28/01/2018 - A Brief Guide to Life - 5. Negotiate with yourself
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    Continuous effort, not strength or intelligence, is the key to unlocking
    our potential.

    Winston Churchill

Negotaite with yourself as you would someone valuable and with whom you want
a valued relationship. Don't be a dictator to yourself, telling yourself what
to do. You are not your own servant.

28/01/2018 - A Brief Guide to Life - 6. Be Good To Yourself
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself. Own your own success.

    Sheryl Sandberg

Treat yourself as you would a person you respect and love. Respect your
potential and ackowledge that what you do matters.


28/01/2018 - A Brief Guide to Life - 7. Be Free From Your Past
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    That is what life is: a chain reaction of individuals colliding with others
    and influencing thier lives without realizing it. A decision that seems 
    miniscule to you may be menumental to the fate of the world.

    J.D. Stoube

If you want to change the world, change yourself not other people. Sort yourself
out. It's hard. We have monsters and they must be faced. Memories more that 18
months old only hang around because we have not resolved them.

You remember the past to analyuze their causal chains. We remember the past to
learn for the future.

29/01/2018 - Jordan Peterson - How to Move Forward In Life
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    You are not the master of your own house.
    There are spirits that dwell within you.

    Carl Jung

`How to Move Forward in Life <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRkG7PccPI>`_
is again a great talk with a lot of wisom. The fact that we do not operate
in isolation and are affected by others is an important point for me.

In recovery, we are often criticised  when we attribute responsibility to
others because we "are not taking responsibililty". That is sometimes a valid
criticism as we are *always* responsible for our actions and must accept
responsibililty for that. This is not the same, however, as denying others have
influence. Other play a role an influence us: that is reality, and is not the
same as denying responsibility for our actions (and reactions).

30/01/2018 - Planning and Prepaaration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tomorrow is my appointment with Judith Gordon-Drake. And the last day of the
month. Tomorrow I will prepare for stating my *Gratitude* routines e.g. making
a daily list of 3 things I am grateful for and thanking someone for something.
At least I think those those are all the thigns?

And I will start reading Shawn Achor's "The Happiness Advantage". *Stop
procrasting* as Mr. Peterson points out. I need to put renewed focus on my
recovery. Disaster is nigh. I cannot afford to give Claire any more ammunition
that she has. Which, lets face it, is plenty.

31/01/2018 - Meeting Judith
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::
 
    At first alcohol gave me wings.
    Then it took away the sky.

    From the AA Big Book.

The meeting with Judith went very well. As a social worker with a lot of
experience in this field, she is well equiped to help. I also felt she
listens well and understand my needs.

So, we will do a weekly therapy session on Friday. This will include an
alcohol test which I will also do on Monday after work.

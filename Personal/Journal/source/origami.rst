The Zen of Origami
------------------

The spirit behind Origami is that of mindfullness. The art of folding is a
dance with the paper to the end form.

Some guidelines to keep in mind are:

* Fold on a smooth, flat, clean surface
* Always fold away from you
* Make firm, sharp creases
* Take your time to be accurate
